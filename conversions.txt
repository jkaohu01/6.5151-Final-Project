Maps symbols used in the book to symbols used in our code. Note
only remapped symbols which are callable anywhere (usually as procedures)
are defined here. Sometimes our code deviates from symbols used in book
but these are only local changes that don't matter system-wide.

ρ -> real-component

κ -> link-component

map* -> differentiable-map

dual* -> truncated-dual

∇ -> gradient

θ -> theta
