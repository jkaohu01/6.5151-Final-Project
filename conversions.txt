Maps symbols used in the book to symbols used in our code. Note
only remapped symbols which are callable anywhere (usually as procedures)
are defined here. Sometimes our code deviates from symbols used in book
but these are only local changes that don't matter system-wide.

ρ -> real-component

κ -> link-component

d -> scalar

map* -> differentiable-map

dual* -> truncated-dual

∇ -> gradient-of (same as book)

θ -> theta

∇_{once} -> gradient-once 

σ -> state-table

∇_{σ} -> gradient-state

∇_{σ}-list -> gradient-state-list

∇_{σ}-vec -> gradient-state-vec

book notation: +^{0,0}  malt github repo notation: +-0-0       -> our code notation: 0-0:+
Generalization: (book) [symbol]^{0,0}  (malt repo) [symbol]-0-0     -> (our code) 0-0:[symbol]

book notation: exp^{0}  malt github repo notation: exp-0       -> our code notation: 0:exp
Generalization: (book) [symbol]^{0}    (malt repo) [symbol]-0       -> (our code) 0:[symbol]
