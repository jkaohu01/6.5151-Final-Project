The standard scheme operators are defined in s:<operator-name> for
some defined operators in primitive-scheme-operators.scm

Use the standard scheme operators when you know the operation is
being performed only on numbers. This stops unecessary duals and
links from being created.

The +, -, *, / operators as well as others are overriden to
operate on tensors and duals. Use these when you know the operation
is being performed on tensors or duals. This can be tricky since
some duals are also just numbers. However, think about whether you
want to store the history of this operation. If you want to store
the history of this operation, use the overriden +, -, *, / operators
but otherwise use the s:+, s:-, s:*, s:/ operators when you do not
care about the history. The history will be stored in the form of
links which will be used to calculate the gradient of the values
resulting from using these history-storing operators.

When in doubt, just use the +, -, *, / operators to store history.
Better to have unecessary history than no history when needed. Also,
if these values are temporary, they will be garbage collected so it
will not matter. Also, sometimes a function expects a number as input
so a warning/error will be raised if attempted to pass a dual as input.
